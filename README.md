BINARY SEARCH 

PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM

The program takes array inputs and the target element from the user,prints the unsorted array,sorts the array to enable working of the binary search algorithm and then prints the sorted array.
The binary search algorithm is then invoked to search for an element.
An element is searched in logarithmic time-O(logn).
